								<h2>Ethics Clearance</h2>
                                
                                <p>This research was granted ethical clearance by the University of Cape Town Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all of the research participants, and we took great care to ensure that they were always comfortable with the research and their participation in it.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Obtaining Informed Consent</h2>
                                
                                <p>Intially, all participants were sent a copy of our informed consent form to go over. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we requested that the participants either sign the form electronically or provide their consent as a written response, or verbally. At the onset of each interview we addressed any questions or concerns that the participants had, and gave them a thorough overview of the project as a whole. In addition, we made an effort to stress that their involvement in the research should be done on their terms - suggesting interview times that fitted into their schedules, and being accomodating to interuptions. This was particularly important for our donor participants, who were sometimes interupted by their children and babies. By always ensuring that our participants were willing to be interviewed and remain involved in the research, we were able to provide a comfortable and relaxed interview environment.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Working in a Sensative Context</h2>
                                
                                <p>This research required us to work within a  sensative and complex context, namely motherhood, breast feeding and milk donation. As such, we had to remain concious of the various nuances surrounding each of these contexts. We conducted our own background research and were exposed to the various sensativties through volunteering at Milk Matters and through discussion with their staff. This not only allowed us to be more informed in the interviews, further improving our ability to sympathise and empathise with our participants and their experiences, but also enabled us to draw more insightful conclusions from our findings.</p>
                                
                                <p>A particularly crucial aspect of designing an application in the breast feeding and milk donation context was the inherint uniqueness of each donation and breast feeding experience. Breast feeding can be an incredibly challenging endevour for mothers, and this extends to milk donation as well. We had to remain sensative to this throughout our design of the application's user experience. This manifested in several ways in the application, however a two examples are treating all donation amounts equally, and avoiding functionality that introducted aspects of comparison and competition. </p>
