							<p>In approaching this study, we decided to utalize a co-design process not unlike that used by Wardle el al. in the previous iteration of this project. Co-design is a design methodology focusing on collaboration between a project's shareholders and designers, and allows for members of a project's targeted userbase to have a say in it's final design.</p>
							<p>While co-design is traditionally conducted through the use of in-person interviews and workshops, the timing of the Covid-19 pandemic prevented us from utalizing this approach. Instead, we formulated an entirely remote co-design process, making heavy use of the online videoconferencing platform <a href=https://meet.jit.si/><i>Jitsi Meet</i></a>.</p>
							<p>We reached out to current <i>Milk Matters</i> donors and staff members to participate in this process. Both of these groups underwent seperate 3-stage interview processes, with an additional survey being distributed to the entire current <i>Milk Matters</i> donor base. The 3-stage interview process was as follows:</p>
							<h3>Stage 1</h3>
							<p>Stage 1 was conducted as an initial ice-breaking interview. Informed consent to the rest of the study was gathered from the participant, and they were introduced to the general structure and style of the interviews going forward. Some light requirements gathering was conducted as well.</p>
							<h3>Stage 2</h3>
							<p>After stage 1, some virtual "paper prototypes" were created using an online tool known as <a href=https://moqups.com/><i>Moqups</i></a>. A usability evaluation was performed on these with the participants, with the aim of gauging the utility of certain pieces of functionality, as well as the user-friendliness of the interface.</p>
							<h3>Stage 3</h3>
							<p>Between stages 2 and 3, development of the final applications was completed. Stage 3 was once again a usability evaluation, but this time using the actual applications. The gol of this stage was to evaluate the final application design, as well as some changes that had been implemented in response to Stage 2 feedback. Additionally, after the evaluation, the participants were questioned about their experiences during the design process.</p>
