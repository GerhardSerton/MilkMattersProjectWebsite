								<h2>Conclusions</h2>
								<p>Following the evaluation of the final applications with both our donor participants and Milk Matters staff, we have deemed the project a success.</p>
                                
                                <p>The system developed, including the Milk Matters web-app, the donor mobile application and the back-end Firebase system, met almost all of the functional and non-functional requirements. Conflict around requirements or feature requests between Milk Matters and the donor participants were handled carefully, making compromises to satisfy both parties. Milk Matters were pleased with the functionality provided on the web-app, and the design and functionality of the donor application. They were also impressed with our execution of the project - engaging with their organisation to fully understand the milk donation context, and our general handling of communication, meetings and interviews.</p>
                                
                                <p>Based on positive feedback received on the donor application from the donor participants we believe that this aspect of the project was also a success. The donors participating in the research believed that the application would supporting and simplifying their milk donation tasks. In terms of the user interface and user experience, the participants found the application intuitive, simple to use and well designed. </p>
                                
                                <p>Ensuring the sustainability and longevity of the donor application was a primary requirement for this project. Functionality provided on the Milk Matters web-app which allows them to update the donor application's content achieves the medium term sustainability. Following the deployment of the application, we hope to conduct a beta-testing period. Through the improvements made, based on the beta-testing feedback, we hope to ensure the long-term sustainability of the application.</p>
                                
                                <p>While a long-term evaluation is required to addequately measure the impact of this project, the feedback we have recieved thus far is very encouraging. By supporting and improving the Milk Matters donor experience we aimed to increase the awareness of breast milk donation and the availability of donor milk, ultimately saving the lives of vulnerable infants.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Future Work</h2>
								<p>While we consider the project to be a success, there are several aspects of it that could be improved in future revisions.</p>
								<p>While the co-design process was forced to be completed remotely, several aspects of this approach could be improved in the future. For instance, while the researchers relied on having the participants navigate both the prototype and the final application verbally, this was less than ideal as it was not an accurate representation of using the applications. In future efforts, researchers could attempt to give control of their screens to participants using some form of “Remote Access” software, allowing participants to navigate the prototypes themselves. Additionally, beta-testing programs such as Apple’s Test Flight could be utilized in longer-form studies to give participants early access to the application on their mobile phones, without having to meet physically. Finally, while it was not explored in this context for several reasons, future work could attempt to simulate in-person workshops using multi-participant videoconferences.</p>
								<p>Several pieces of functionality were suggested by the participants but were ultimately not included in the final application due to development time constraints. For instance, during the Stage 3 interviews both staff members suggested the ability to manually add milk donations to the “Dropoff Declarer” using the staff application. This would allow them to account for any donors that have not used to application to declare a drop-off but have instead contacted Milk Matters in some other fashion. While there currently exists a work-around to support this, a more standardized method of performing this action could allow for much more accurate tracking of drop-off amounts. Multiple donors also requested a feature that would remind them when they would need to take an HIV-test again, a requirement to remain a registered donor. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, this feature was not implemented.</p>
