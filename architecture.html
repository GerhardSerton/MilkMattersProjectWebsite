								<h2>Cloud-Based Backend</h2>
								<p>Through our stage 1 interviews with Milk Matters staff members, it quickly became apparent that the backed implementation would need to be as cheap as possible, as well as allow for the secure storage of sensitive information. In order to broadly meet these needs, we decided to investigate several cloud-based solutions, as opposed to a system physically owned by Milk Matters. Cloud based services have drastically fallen in cost over the years and represent a solution that requires no investment in physical infrastructure. Additionally, server up-time is virtually completely consistent, as most established cloud services have multiple solutions in place preventing this from occurring. This is especially notable in South Africa, as any solution based locally would be subject to “loadshedding” (regular, scheduled blackouts). Without the additional investment of a generator, this would result in regular downtimes for any physical servers. Finally, most cloud-based service providers are relatively secure, with attacks on them usually made possible by the client’s implementation of the service, and not any inherent weakness in the service itself. </p>
								<p>We ultimately settled on Google Firebase for several reasons. Most important was the cost associated with it: while many cloud providers provide free tiers of use, Firebase supports not only a particularly generous one, but also implements a pay-as-you-go scheme, whereby one only has to pay for the functionality they use. This results in an incredibly low cost-to-client, even in the event of them breaking out of the free tier. </p>
								<p>While Firebase offers many different services, we opted to use only three in total: the “Realtime Database”, the “Firebase Authentication Service”, and the “Firebase Hosting”. The “Realtime Database” is a NoSQL cloud database that syncs its data across all its clients in real time. Due to this, every client that has managed to sync at least once will keep a local copy of the database, allowing for functionality to be maintained even when the connection to the cloud services is lost. This functionality is especially important in a South African context, where internet connectivity is by no means a constant. “Firebase Authentication” is a prebuilt authentication system, allowing for the easy management of user accounts. Finally, “Firebase Hosting” allows for the easy and free hosting of webapps, something that we leveraged for the staff-facing application. </p>
								<p>For the “Realtime Database” under the free pricing tier, we were allocated 1GB of storage, 100 simultaneous connections, and 10GB of downloads per month. While this may seem small, for our purposes it was plenty as most of the data to be stored is be text-only, with most of it being cleared intermittently. Additionally, Milk Matters only keeps around 20 active donors at a time, something recorded by Wardle et al. and confirmed to still be true by us. This group would represent the most active users of the application, as they would be the ones using the more query-intensive functionality such as the depot locator and the drop-off declarer. This small size makes it unlikely for 100 simultaneous connections to ever be exceeded.</p>
